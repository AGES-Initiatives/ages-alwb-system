Ἄξιόν ἐστιν ὡς ἀληθῶς 
μακαρίζειν σε 
τὴν Θεοτόκον 
τὴν ἀειμακάριστον καὶ παναμμώμητον 
καὶ μητέρα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν.

Yes indeed, it is 

Truly it right 
Right it is indeed to call you blest

It is truly right to call you blest

whom all generations 
for all generations call you blest 




as the one eternally extolled, the all-immaculate 
Theotokos and Mother of our God
