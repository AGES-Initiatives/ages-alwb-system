Τὸν Σταυρὸν τοῦ Χριστοῦ, λαβόντες οἱ ἅγιοι Μάρτυρες, ὅπλον ἀκαταγώνιστον, 
πᾶσαν τοῦ διαβόλου τὴν ἰσχὺν κατήργησαν, 
καὶ λαβόντες στέφος οὐράνιον, 
τεῖχος ἡμῖν γεγόνασιν, 
ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἀεὶ πρεσβεύοντες.

The holy Martyrs took the Cross of Christ as invincible armor, and they neutralized all the power of the devil. They were awarded heavenly medals, and now for us they have become a fortification, as they ever intercede on our behalf.
