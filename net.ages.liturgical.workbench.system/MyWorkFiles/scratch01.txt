Ὅλος ἐκ νεότητος ἐγώ, 
πάθεσιν αἰσχύνης δουλεύσας, καὶ ἀσωτίᾳ πολλῇ, 
τέλεον ἠμαύρωσα, τὸ κατʼ εἰκόνα Θεοῦ, 
καὶ πτοοῦμαι Πανύμνητε, τὴν μέλλουσαν δίκην, 
ὅτε παραστήσομαι τῷ σῷ Υἱῷ καὶ Θεῷ· 
νῦν οὖν πρὸ τοῦ τέλους μοι δίδου, 
κάθαρσιν Ἁγνὴ τῶν παθῶν μου, 
καὶ πλημμελημάτων ἀπολύτρωσιν.


Since my adolescence I have been 
a slave to despicable passions. Through immorality 
I defaced the part of me that is the image of God. 
O pure Virgin, I am afraid of imminent judgment, 
when I shall appear before your Son and God to be judged. 
Purge me of my passions, I beg you, 
before my demise, holy Lady, 
and secure a pardon for my trespasses.


Purge me of my passions, I beg you, 
before my demise, holy Lady, 
and secure a pardon for my tresspasses.
