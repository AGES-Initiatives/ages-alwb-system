Σαρκὸς τὸ ἐκτύπωμα, ἀναστηλοῦντές σου Κύριε, σχετικῶς ἀσπαζόμεθα, 
τὸ μέγα μυστήριον, τῆς Οἰκονομίας, 
τῆς σῆς ἐκδηλοῦντες· οὐ γὰρ δοκήσει, ὡς φασίν, 
οἱ θεομάχοι παῖδες τοῦ Μάνεντος, 
ἡμῖν ὤφθης φιλάνθρωπε, ἀλλʼ ἀληθείᾳ καὶ φύσει σαρκός, 
διʼ αὐτοῦ ἀναγόμενοι, 
πρὸς σὸν πόθον καὶ ἔρωτα.



We now reestablish the representation of You, O Lord, * in the flesh, and we reverence it * 
relatively, and by it * show forth the great myst'ry * 
of Your Dispensation. * For You, O Friend of man, appeared * 
in truth and physical nature unto us, * 
not merely in appearance as the sons of Manis, Your enemies, say.* 
Through Your icon we are led up * 
to a longing and love for You.



As we now restore depictions of Your body, we honor them with a kiss, venerating them 
relatively, and thereby we declare the mys'try 
of Your plan to save us. * O Lord, You truly came to us 
in human nature, in Your benevolence, 
not merely in appearance, as the sons of Manis, Your enemies, say.* 
Through the icons of You we are 
led to longing and love for You.

In Your benevolence, O Lord, 
to us You came in human nature indeed, 


Through Your icon to love for You 
we are led up to love

We are led up to love

To the longing and love for You 
we are led up by 

Through the icons of You we are 
led to longing and love for You.
