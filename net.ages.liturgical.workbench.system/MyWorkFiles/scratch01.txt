Τῆς στειρευούσης τὸ βλάστημα, τὸ τῆς ἁγνείας φυτόν, 
τῶν βροτῶν ἐγκαλλώπισμα, 
τοῦ Δεσπότου Πρόδρομε, Ἰωάννη πανεύφημε, 
φύλαξ ὁ θεῖος, τῆς ταπεινῆς μου ψυχῆς, 
τὴν σὴν πρεσβείαν, καὶ τὴν βοήθειαν, 
δίδου λυτρούμενος, 
μηχανῶν τοῦ ὄφεως, καὶ πονηρᾶς, 
τούτου με κακώσεως, καὶ ἐπιθέσεως.


You are the offspring of chastity, the barren woman's son, 
and the pride of humanity, 
and the Master's Forerunner, O all-laudable Baptist John. 
You are the holy protector of my soul.  
I pray you grant me your help forevermore 
and intercede for me, 
so that I be rescued from the wicked schemes 
of the evil serpent to attack and injure me.
