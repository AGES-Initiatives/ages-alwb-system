Τὴν ὥραν τῆς ἐτάσεως, 
καὶ τῆς φρικτῆς ἐλεύσεως, 
τοῦ φιλανθρώπου Δεσπότου, 
κατανοῶν ὅλως τρέμω, 
καὶ σκυθρωπάζων κράζω σοι· 
Κριτά μου δικαιότατε, 
καὶ μόνε πολυέλεε, 
μετανοοῦντά με δέξαι, 
τῆς Θεοτόκου πρεσβείαις.

When I reflect upon the hour * 
of the interrogation, Lord, * 
and of the frightening coming * 
of You, benevolent Master, * 

I shake all over and I cry * dejected: O my Judge most just * and only very merciful,* accept me now in repentance,* through prayers of the Theotokos."


O Lord, when I reflect upon 
the hour of Your frightening 
return and interrogation, 

the hour when You come again 
to sit in 



When I reflect upon the hour of Your return and frightening * interrogation and judgment, * benevolent Lord, I shudder * and shake all over, and I cry dejected: O my Judge, most just * and only very merciful,* accept me now in repentance,* through prayers of the Theotokos.

O my very just * and merciful Judge, accept me * repenting, and heed Your Mother * on my behalf interceding.


When I reflect upon the hour of Your return and frightening * 
interrogation and judgment, * I shudder and shake all over. * 
Dejected I cry out to You, my Judge most just yet merciful: * 
Benevolent Lord, as I am * repenting, I pray accept me, * at Your Mother's intercessions.



and I cry dejected: O my Judge, most just * and only very merciful,* accept me now in repentance,* at Your Mother's intercessions.

I cry dejected, 
Benevolent Lord, as I am repenting, I pray accept me,
