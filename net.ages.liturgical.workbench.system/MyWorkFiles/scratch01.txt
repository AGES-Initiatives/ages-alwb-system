Ξύλου βρώσει τέθνηκα ποτέ, 
συμβουλίᾳ ὄφεως, συνεπαρθεὶς καὶ ἐξόριστος, τῆς θείας δόξης σου, 
γεγονὼς ὁ τάλας· 
διὸ τεθανάτωμαι, 
ὑπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας ὁ δείλαιος· λοιπὸν Φιλάνθρωπε, 
σὺ ὡς μόνος εὐδιάλλακτος, 
Παραδείσου οἰκήτορα ποίησον.




I ate from the tree of old and died, 
when the serpent counseled Eve and I got carried away, and, woe is me, I was exiled
from Your divine glory. 
Even now my sorry soul 
is put to death by sin. O benevolent and only placable 
Lord, I beg You, praying fervently, 
please allow me to inhabit Paradise.
