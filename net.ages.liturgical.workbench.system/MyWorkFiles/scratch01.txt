Πρὸ τοῦ τιμίου σταυροῦ σου καὶ τοῦ Πάθους, 
θαυμάτων τὰ ἔνδοξα, ἐπιτελῶν τοῖς λαοῖς, 
τῆς ἑορτῆς καθὼς γέγραπται, ἐν μέσῳ ἔστης, 
τῆς νομικῆς Χριστὲ Παντοδύναμε, 
καὶ πᾶσιν ἐβόησας· Εἴ τις διψᾷ, πρὸς ἐμὲ 
αὐτομολείτω, καὶ ὕδατος τοῦ θείου πόμα, 
ἀπαντλησάτω καὶ ζωῆς νάματα· 
ὕδωρ ζωῆς γὰρ καὶ δυνάμεως 
καὶ σοφίας ἐγὼ πᾶσι δίδωμι, 
ὅτι θέλων ἀνθρώποις, ὡμοιώθην ὡς φιλάνθρωπος.


Before Your Passion and holy crucifixion, * 
for the masses You performed glorious miracles. * 
As it is written, O Christ, You went into the temple * 
and taught, when it was the middle of the feast. * 
On the final day You stood up and proclaimed to all, * 
\"Let him who thirsts come to me and drink, and draw the water * 
of the divine drink of life, for unto all * I give the water of immortal life, * might, and wisdom, for truly I willingly * become human, for I am * God almighty and benevolent.
