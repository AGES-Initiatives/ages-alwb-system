Σταυρὸν καὶ τὸν θάνατον, ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἀγαθέ, 
διʼ ἄμετρον ἔλεος, ἑκὼν ὑπέμεινας, 
καὶ κρίσιν τὴν ἄδικον, 
ὅπως τῆς καταδίκης, καὶ ἀρχαίας κατάρας, 
πάντας ἐλευθερώσῃς, τοὺς ἀπάτῃ φθαρέντας· 
διό σου προσκυνοῦμεν, Λόγε τὴν Σταύρωσιν.




Frightening indeed, and quite so, is the mystery known as death, how a soul then is forcibly * separated from its frame, parting from its body; * 
severed is that union, which is most natural and innate, * 
by Your divine will. And therefore we entreat * 
that You who are benevolent grant the departed eternal rest, * 
where the saints and the righteous dwell, * O our God and the Giver of life."
