Ἐν κλίνῃ κατακείμενος, ἁμαρτημάτων πολλῶν, 
συλῶμαι τὴν ἐλπίδα τῆς σωτηρίας μου· 
ὁ γὰρ ὕπνος τῆς ἐμῆς ῥαθυμίας, 
προξενεῖ μου τῇ ψυχῇ τιμωρίαν· 
ἀλλὰ σὺ ὁ Θεός, ὁ τεχθεὶς ἐκ Παρθένου, 
διέγειρόν με πρὸς τὴν σὴν ὑμνῳδίαν, 
ἵνα δοξάζω σε.



I am lying sick in the bed of many sins, 
and I am stripped of any hope of salvation. 
The sleep of my inertia will be the cause of my soul's perdition. 
O God, who were born of the Virgin, 
I pray You wake me up, 
and stir me to extol You, 
and I will glorify You.
