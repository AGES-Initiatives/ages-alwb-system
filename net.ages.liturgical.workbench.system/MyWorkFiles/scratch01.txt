Τὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ Υἱὸν ἡ Παρθένος ἐν ἀγκάλαις κρατοῦσα, 
καὶ μητρικοῖς ἀσπασμοῖς καταφιλοῦσα ἐφθέγγετο· 
Σπορὰν οὐκ ἔγνων ἐν τῇ συλλήψει, 
καὶ φθορὰν οὐχ ὑπέστην ἐν τῇ γεννήσει, 
ἀλλʼ ἁγνὴ ὥσπερ πρώην εἰμὶ καὶ μετὰ γέννησιν· 
διό σου προσκυνῶ Τέκνον τὴν πολλὴν εὐσπλαγχνίαν, 
καὶ ἄφατον μεγαλουργίαν, 
ἣν ἔδειξας εἰς ἐμέ· 
ὅθεν καὶ ἀγάλλομαι, κρατοῦσα ἐν κόλποις τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ.






The Virgin held the Son of God in her arms, 
and she smothered Him with maternal kisses and said, 
\"I conceived without having sex, 
and I gave birth to You and my body is intact. 
Even after childbirth, I am a virgin as before. 
So I adore Your great compassion 
and the ineffable miracle You have done in me, my Child. 
Therefore I greatly rejoice, as I hold in my embraces the Son of God.\"
