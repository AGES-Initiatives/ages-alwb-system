Βεβασιλευκότα, παθῶν διὰ καρτερίας, ὁ Χριστὸς σε προσήκατο, Συμεὼν θεοφόρε, τῆς αὐτοῦ κοινωνὸν σκηπτουχίας· ὅθεν σε ὕμνοις μεγαλύνομεν.




Ἰαματικῆς, χάριτος κατηξιωμένος, ἐξ ἀσύλων τοῦ Πνεύματος θησαυρῶν θεοφόρε, Συμεὼν τὰς ἰάσεις βραβεύεις, τοῖς πανηγυρίζουσι τὴν μνήμην σου."

Ἐπιβεβηκώς, Ὅσιε τῆς οὐρανοδρόμου ἀρετῆς, καὶ αἰθέριον ἆθλον ἐνδεδειγμένος, καὶ πρὸς σκηνὰς ἀναπτὰς οὐρανίους, πρέσβευε σωθῆναι τὰς ψυχὰς ἡμῶν."


Βάτος καιομένη, πυρὶ καὶ μὴ φλεγομένη, ἀνεδείχθης ὦ Παρθένε, συλλαβοῦσα ἀσπόρως, τὸν Θεὸν καὶ Σωτῆρα τοῦ κόσμου, ὃν ἀκαταπαύστως μεγαλύνομεν."






O God-bearing father Symeon, Christ adopted you to reign with Him, for by your endurance you reigned over passions. Therefore we sing hymns to magnify you.

 

To you was granted the grace to heal, O God-bearing Symeon. From the Spirit's inviolable treasures, you provide healing to those who celebrate your memory.

 

You advanced in virtue that led you to heaven. You display your celestial prize. You have gone up to the heavenly mansions. O devout father, we pray you intercede for the salvation of our souls.

Theotokion

O Virgin, the burning bush that was not consumed prefigured you, who without seed conceived God, the Savior of the world, whom we unceasingly magnify.
