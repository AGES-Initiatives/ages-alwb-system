Ἡ προεκλελεγμένη, 7
εἰσάκουσον τῆς φωνῆς ἡμῶν, 9
καὶ δώρησαι, 4
τὰ αἰτήματα ταῖς ψυχαῖς ἡμῶν· 10
λύτρωσαι ἡμᾶς παθῶν καὶ τῶν ὀδυνῶν, 12
διὰ τῶν Ἀποστόλων, 7
πάντα δυναμένη ὡς Μήτηρ Θεοῦ. 10\11



O Virgin, you were chosen 
ahead of time. We implore you now 
to hear our prayer 
and to grant us our soulful requests. 
Free us from the passions of our bodies and souls, 
through the holy Apostles. 
You can do all things, as the Mother of God.
