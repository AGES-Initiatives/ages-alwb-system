Τρυγὼν ἡ φιλέρημος, ὁ ἱερὸς Βαπτιστής, 
κηρύξας μετάνοιαν, καὶ φανερώσας Χριστόν, 
γενόμενον ἄνθρωπον, 
πάντων ἁμαρτανόντων, ἐγεννήθη προστάτης, 
πᾶσι χειμαζομένοις βοηθῶν ἀενάως. 
Αὐτοῦ ταῖς ἱκεσίαις Χριστέ, σῶσον τὸν κόσμον σου.


That solitude-loving turtle-dove, the holy Baptist St. John, 
the preacher of repentance and the one who pointed to Christ 
when He became man for us, 
has become for all sinners an advocate and defender. 
He is a ready helper of all who are in trouble. 
By his intercessions, O Christ, rescue and save Your world.

Ἡ μόνη κυήσασα, τὸν ποιητὴν τοῦ παντός, 
ἡ μονη κοσμήσασα, τὴν ἀνθρωπότητα, 
τῷ τόκῳ σου Ἄχραντε, 
ῥῦσαί με τῶν παγίδων, τοῦ δολίου Βελίαρ, 
στῆσόν με ἐπὶ πέτραν, τῶν Χριστοῦ θελημάτων, 
αὐτὸν ἐκδυσωποῦσα ἐκτενῶς, ὃν ἐσωμάτωσας.

Immaculate Virgin, you alone conceived in your womb 
the Maker of all, and by your giving birth you alone 
have honored humanity.
Free me from all the snares that the devil has set for me, 
establish my on the rock of the words and the will of Christ. 
To Him who became incarnate from you, pray for me earnestly.




ocMA.Aposticha2
Ζάλη ἁμαρτημάτων περιέχει με Σωτήρ, 
καὶ μὴ φέρων τὸν κλύδωνα, σοὶ προσπίπτω τῷ μόνῳ Κυβερνήτῃ, 
ὡς τῷ Πέτρῳ τὴν χεῖρά μοι ἔκτεινον, 
τῆς φιλανθρωπίας σου, καὶ σῶσόν με.


The storm that my sins have caused encompasses me, O Savior, 
Unable to withstand the waves, I cry to You, my only Pilot. 
Reach out the hand of Your benevolence to me, as You did to Peter, and save me.

ocMA.AposTheotokion
Θεοτόκε Παντάνασσα, τῶν Ὀρθοδόξων τὸ καύχημα, 
αἱρετικῶν τὰ φρυάγματα, καὶ τὰ πρόσωπα καταίσχυνον, 
τῶν μὴ προσκυνούντων, μηδὲ τιμώντων, Πάναγνε, τὴν σεβάσμιον εἰκόνα σου.


All pure Theotokos and Queen of all, the Orthodox boast about you. 
We pray you bring dishonor and embarrassment on the insolent heretics, 
who neither venerate nor honor your holy icon.


ocMA.Kathisma31
Ἐν Παραδείσῳ με δεινῶς πεπτωκότα, 
τοῦ βροτοκτόνου τῇ πικρᾷ συμβουλίᾳ, 
ἐν τῷ Κρανίῳ πάλιν ἐξανέστησας Χριστέ, 
ξύλῳ ἰασάμενος, τὴν τοῦ ξύλου κατάραν, 
κτείνας τὸν ἀπάτῃ με, θανατώσαντα ὄφιν, 
καὶ ἐδωρήσω θείαν μοι ζωήν. 
Δόξα τῇ θείᾳ σταυρώσει σου Κύριε.



I had a fatal fall in Eden by heeding 
the poison counsel of the muderous devil. 
But then You resurrected me on Calvary, O Christ. 
By a tree you healed the curse of the tree, O my Savior, 
and you killed the serpant fiend who had killed me by deception. 
And You have given me eternal life. 
Glory to Your holy crucifixion, O Lord my God!
