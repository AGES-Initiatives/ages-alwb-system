Γέγονα καταγώγιον οἴμοι! 10
τῶν ἡδονῶν ὁ πανάθλιος! 9
Γέλως οὖν ὁρῶμαι, ἀεὶ τοῖς ἐχθροῖς μου· 12
ὅθεν σοι προσπίπτω ἁγία Παρθένε, 12
ἴδε μου τὴν θλῖψιν, καὶ βοήθειάν μοι ὄρεξον, 15
καὶ δακρύοις κάθαρον, καὶ ῥῦσαί με δέομαι, 14
καὶ καταισχυνθείησαν, 7
οἱ χαίροντες Ἁγνὴ τῇ ἀπωλείᾳ μου. 12


I have become a lair of the pleasures. 
Alas! And now I am miserable. 
Therefore I am laughed at by my adversaries. 
O all-holy Lady, I earnestly implore you: 
Seeing me afflicted, please extend a helping hand to me. 
Grant me tears to wash me clean. I pray you to rescue me, 
O Virgin, and let all those 
who rejoice at my destruction be put to shame.
