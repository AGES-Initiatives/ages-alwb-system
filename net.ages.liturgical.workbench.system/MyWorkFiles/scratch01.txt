ocMA.Aposticha3
Ἐν ταῖς βασάνοις ὄντες οἱ Ἅγιοι, ἀγαλλόμενοι ἐβόων· 
Συναλλάγματα ἡμῖν ἐστι ταῦτα, πρὸς τὸν Δεσπότην· 
ἀντὶ γὰρ τῶν ἐπανισταμένων, μωλώπων τῷ σώματι, 
φωτεινόν ἔνδυμα, ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει ἐπανθήσει ἡμῖν· 
ἀντὶ δεσμωτηρίων ὁ Παράδεισος· 
καὶ ἀντὶ τῆς μετὰ τῶν κακούργων καταδίκης, ἡ μετὰ τῶν Ἀγγέλων διαγωγή. 
Εὐχαῖς αὐτῶν Κύριε, σῶσον τὰς ψυχὰς ἡμῶν."



As the Saints were being tortured, they sang in exultation, 
\"These are all for us a transaction with Master. 

We will trade what we suffer now in our transactions with the Master. 
For instead of the physical injuries we are sustaining, 
in the resurrection He will dress us with a luminous garment. 
Instead of the prison there will be Paradise. 
And instead of being sentenced with criminals, we will be in the company of Angels.\"
O Lord, we pray You save our souls, at their supplications.
