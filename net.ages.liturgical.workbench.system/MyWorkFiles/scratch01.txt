Οὐρανίας ἁψῖδος, ὀροφουργὲ Κύριε, 
καὶ τῆς Ἐκκλησίας Δομῆτορ, σὺ με στερέωσον, 
ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ τῇ σῇ, τῶν ἐφετῶν ἡ ἀκρότης, 
τῶν πιστῶν τὸ στήριγμα, μόνε φιλάνθρωπε.



O divine Master Builder of the celestial vault, * 
as the only Lover of mankind and Founder of the Church, * 
establish me, O Lord, in love for You, the believers' * 
firm support and ultimate object of all desire.


O divine Master Builder of the celestial vault, * 
Founder of the Church and the ultimate object of desire, * 
only benevolent support of every believer, * 
in the love for You, O Lord, firmly establish me.
