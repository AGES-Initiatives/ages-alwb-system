 Σῶσόν με Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου· 10
 σὺ γὰρ πάντων ἡ σωτηρία, 
 ὁ κλύδων με τῶν παθῶν ἐκταράττει, 11
 καὶ τὸ βάρος τῶν ἀνομιῶν με βυθίζει, 13
 δός μοι χεῖρα βοηθείας, 
 καὶ πρὸς φῶς ἀνάγαγε με κατανύξεως, 13
 ὡς μόνος εὔσπλαγχνος καὶ φιλάνθρωπος. 11
O onl


Save me, O Lord God my Savior, save me! * 
For all people You are salvation. * 
The storm of the sinful passions disturbs me. * 
I am sinking because of the weight of transgressions. * 
Please extend Your hand and help me. * 
To the light of true compunction lead me up, O Lord, * 
alone compassionate and benevolent.



lead me up

only Compassionate and Lover of man.
