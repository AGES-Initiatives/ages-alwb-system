Τὰ ἐπουράνια, φόβῳ ἠγάλλοντο, 
καὶ τὰ ἐπίγεια, πόθῳ ηὐφραίνοντο, 
ὅτε ἡ ἄχραντος φωνή, ἐπῆλθέ σοι Θεοτόκε· 
μία γὰρ πανήγυρις, ἀμφοτέροις ἐπέλαμψε, 
ὅτε τὸν πρωτόπλαστον, ὁ Δεσπότης ἐῤῥύσατο. 
Διὸ σὺν τῷ Ἀγγέλῳ βοῶμέν σοι· Χαῖρε ἡ Κεχαριτωμένη."

All beings heavenly rejoiced with solemn awe 
and even earth itself was very glad indeed 
O Theotokos, when that pure salutation was spoken to you. 
and there was a unified celebration in both locales, 
when the Master freed from death 
when the first-created man was delivered by your Son and God. 
And therefore with the Angel we say to you: Rejoice, O Maiden full of grace!

Ἡ κτίσις ἠλλοιώθη Λόγε τῇ σταυρώσει σου, 
ὁ ἥλιος ἀκτῖνας, συνέστειλε τῷ φόβῳ, 
καὶ ναοῦ τὸ καταπέτασμα ἐσχίσθη, 
καὶ πᾶς πιστὸς σέσωσται· 
ὅθεν δοξάζομεν, 
σοῦ τὸν ἄμετρον πλοῦτον.

Creation was affected, O Word, when You crucified. 
The sun concealed its rays out of fear, and the earth shook, 
and the curtain of the Temple was torn in two, 
and all believers have been saved. 
And now we glorify 
Your immense wealth of mercy.

oc.m3.d4.ocMA.Kathisma31
Σταυρὸν ὑπέμεινας, ἀτίμως Δέσποτα, 
ὁ ὑπερέκεινα, πάσης τῆς κτίσεως, 
ὅπως τιμήσῃς με τὸν πρίν, δεινῶς ἀτιμασθέντα, 
λόγχῃ τὴν πλευράν σου δέ, 
ἐκεντήθης μακρόθυμε, 
θέλων ἐκλυτρώσασθαι, 
τῆς φθορᾶς με τὸ πλάσμα σου. 
Ὑμνῶ σου τὴν πολλὴν εὐσπλαγχνίαν, 
καὶ τὴν ἀγαθότητα φιλάνθρωπε.

You who who transcend the whole created universe, 
wishing to honor me who long ago sustained 
the grave dishonor, have endured dishonorable death on the cross. 
And You let your side be pierced 
with a spear, for you wished to free 
from utter destruction me, 
whom You fashioned, O forbearing Lord. 
I glorify Your goodness, O Savior, 
and Your great compassion, O benevolent God.

oc.m3.d4.ocMA.Kathisma33
Ἀναρτηθέντα σε, ὡς ἐθεάσατο, 
ἐν ξύλῳ Δέσποτα, ἡ ἀπειρόγαμος, 
καὶ Παναμώμητος ἁγνή, Παρθένος τε καὶ Μήτηρ σου. 
Οἴμοι! ἀνεβόα σοι· ὦ Υἱέ μου γλυκύτατε, 
πῶς σε ἀνομώτατος, δῆμος ξύλῳ κατέκρινε, 
τὸν πάντων ποιητὴν καὶ Δεσπότην! 
Ὑμνῶ σου τὴν ἄκραν ἀγαθότητα."

When Your immaculate and irreproachable 
and ever-virgin pure, all-holy Mother watched 
as You were crucified, O Lord, she saw You on the cross and wept. 
Tearfully she cried aloud, "Woe is me! O my sweetest Son! 
How could this unlawful crowd condemn You to be crucified, 
for You are Lord of all and Creator! 
I glorify Your goodness that has no end."


oc.m3.d4.ocMA.Aposticha1
Φθόνῳ τρυφῆς ἐκβέβλημαι, πτῶμα πεσὼν χαλεπόν, ἀλλʼ οὐ παρεῖδες Δέσποτα, ἀναλαβὼν διʼ ἐμὲ τὸ κατʼ ἐμέ, σταυροῦσαι, καὶ σῴζεις με, εἰς δόξαν εἰσάγεις με· Λυτρωτά μου, δόξα σοι."

I was cast out of Eden because of envy. It was a terrible fall. But You, O Master, did not overlook me. But You assumed my nature for me, and You were crucified. And You save me and bring me into glory. O my Redeemer, glory to You!

oc.m3.d4.ocMA.Aposticha3
Ὡς φωστῆρες ἐν κόσμῳ λάμπετε, καὶ μετὰ θάνατον ἅγιοι Μάρτυρες, τὸν ἀγῶνα τὸν καλὸν ἀγωνισάμενοι· διὸ ἔχοντες παῤῥησίαν, Χριστὸν ἱκετεύσατε, ἐλεηθῆναι τὰς ψυχὰς ἡμῶν."

O holy Martyrs, even after death, you shine on the world like luminaries, for you fought the good fight. 
Now that you have confidence when praying to Christ, entreat Him to have mercy on our souls.

oc.m3.d4.ocMA.AposTheotokion
Ὁρῶσά σε κρεμάμενον, ἐν ξύλῳ ἡ Πανάμωμος, 
Χριστέ μου ὑπεράγαθε, ὀδυρομένη ἐβόα μητρικῶς· 
Υἱέ μου παμφίλτατε, 
πῶς δῆμος ὁ ἄνομος, ξύλῳ σε κατέκρινε;"

O Christ, my most benevolent Savior, 
when Your irreproachable Mother 
saw You hanging on the cross, 
she lamented and cried aloud, 
"O my beloved Son, 
how could this unlawful crowd condemn You to be crucified!"

Σὲ τὸν κήρυκα, τῆς ἀληθείας, 
καὶ ὑπέρλαμπρον, φωστῆρα κόσμου, 
εὐφημοῦντες ἀνυμνοῦμεν Νικόλαε, 
καὶ ἐκβοῶμεν ἐν πίστει δεόμενοι. 
Ὡς τοὺς ἀθώους θανάτου ἐξήρπασας, 
οὕτως Ἅγιε, κινδύνων ἡμᾶς καὶ θλίψεων, 
καὶ πάσης ἐξελοῦ δεινῆς κακώσεως.

We extol you as a mighty preacher 
of the truth of God, and as a brilliant 
luminary in the world, and we sing your praise, 
as we entreat you with faith and we pray to you: 
As you once rescued those innocent men from death, 
likewise rescue us from danger, O father Nicholas, 
and save us from disasters and accidents.

oc.m3.d5.ocMA.Kathisma33
Θρόνος πάγχρυσος, τοῦ Βασιλέως, 
καὶ Παράδεισος, διηνθισμένος, 
ἀνεδείχθης Θεοτόκε Πανάχραντε· 
τὸν γὰρ Θεὸν ἐν γαστρί σου βαστάσασα, 
εὐωδιάζεις ἡμᾶς θείαις χάρισιν· 
ὅθεν ἅπαντες, Θεοῦ ἀληθῶς Μητέρα σε, 
κηρύττομεν ἀεὶ καὶ μεγαλύνομεν.

We declare that you are truly Mother 
of our God and we all magnify you, 
who carried God in your womb and gave birth to Him. 
O all-immaculate Virgin, and thus you are 
the golden throne of the King of the universe 
metaphorically, and likewise a blooming Paradise, 
for you emit like fragrance the gifts of grace.

oc.m3.d5.ocMA.Aposticha3
Αἱ δυνάμεις τῶν Ἁγίων Ἀγγέλων, ἐθαύμασαν τῶν Μαρτύρων τοὺς ἄθλους, 
ὅτι σῶμα θνητὸν περικείμενοι, βασάνων κατεφρόνησαν, 
μιμηταὶ γενόμενοι, τοῦ Πάθους τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, 
καὶ πρεσβεύουσιν ὑπὲρ τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν.

The hosts of holy Angels were amazed by the contests of the Martyrs. 
For even in their mortal bodies, they disregarded the tortures, 
they imitated the Passion of our Savior, 
and now they intercede on behalf of our souls.
