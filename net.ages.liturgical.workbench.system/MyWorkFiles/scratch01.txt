Ὡς τὸν Προφήτην ἐῤῥύσω, 
ἐκ βυθοῦ κατωτάτου Χριστὲ ὁ Θεός, 
κἀμὲ τῶν πταισμάτων μου, 
ῥῦσαι ὡς φιλάνθρωπος, 
καὶ κυβέρνησον τὴν ζωήν μου δέομαι."

 
 
  O Christ my God, as You rescued * 
  Prophet Jonah of old from the depths of the sea, * 
  I pray You, now rescue me * 
  from my sins, and steer the ship * of my life, as You are my benevolent Lord.
