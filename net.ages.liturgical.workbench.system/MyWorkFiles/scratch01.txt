Ταῖς αὔραις τοῦ ἐχθροῦ ὡς κάλαμος ῥιπίζομαι, 
διηνεκῶς Παρθένε· ἀλλʼ οἴκτειρον τὸν δοῦλόν σου, 
καὶ ταῖς τούτου καταιγίσι μὴ εἰς τέλος, 
ἐάσῃς με κλονεῖσθαι, 
ἀλλὰ στερέωσον, 
ἐν τῇ πίστει Κυρίου.




O Virgin, I am often tempted by the enemy, 
and like a reed is shaken by wind, I am influenced.
I implore you to take pity on your servant, 
Don't let me bend completey




O Virgin, I am often shaken by the enemy, 
like a reed by the wind. Please take pity on your servant, 
and prevent me from completely succumbing 
to his storms of temptations; 
but rather reinforce 
my faith in Christ the Master.
