Ὁ τῆς Πόρνης τὰ δάκρυα, καὶ τοῦ Πέτρου προσδεξάμενος, καὶ Τελώνην δικαιώσας ἐκ βάθους στενάξαντα, κᾀμὲ ἀπεγνωσμένον ἐξ ἔργων, οἴκτειρον Σωτήρ, καὶ σῶσόν με.


O Lord, You accepted the sinful woman's tears, and You justified the Publican when he soulfully sighed. Having no such deeds, I am in despair. O Savior, pity me and save me.




 Ὁ τοῦ Πέτρου τὴν ἄρνησιν, τοῖς δάκρυσι καθαρίσας, καὶ τοῦ τελώνου τὰ πταίσματα, ἐν στεναγμῷ συγχωρήσας, φιλάνθρωπε Κύριε ἐλέησόν με.
O Lord, You washed away Peter's denial with his tears, and You forgave the Publican's sins when he sighed. O benevolent Lord, have mercy on me.
