Τῶν Ζακυνθίων εὐσεβῶς ἡ ὁμήγυρις, 
πανηγυρίσωμεν λαμπρῶς ἑορτάζοντες, 
ἐν ἐτησίοις ᾄσμασι καὶ ὕμνοις ἱεροῖς, 
πάνσεπτον ἐπάνοδον, τοῦ παντίμου λειψάνου, 
τοῦ ἐξανατείλαντος, δίκην κόσμῳ ἡλίου, 
ὃ ἀσπασθέντες κράξωμεν θερμῶς· 
φωστήρων χαῖρε, φωστὴρ Διονύσιε.


Come, all believers, join the people of Zakynthos, 
participating in the yearly festivities, 
by singing sacred hymns and songs in honor of the day 
celebrating the return of the eminent relic 
of the Island's patron Saint, who illumines the whole world. 
And as we venerate him, let us cry aloud, 
“We all salute you, O St. Dionysius.”




Τὴν τοῦ διδασκάλου Χριστοῦ φωνὴν ἐνωτισάμενος, 
ἦρες ἐπ’ ὤμων τὸν Σταυρὸν Αὐτοῦ, 
καὶ ἀκλινῶς ἐπορεύθης τὴν στενὴν καὶ τεθλιμμένην τοῦ ματαίου βίου ὁδόν, 
ἀποῤῥίψας ὄγκον γένους, πραγμάτων περιουσίαν, καὶ πᾶσαν ἄλλην κοσμικὴν ἡδυπάθειαν, 
καὶ μόνος ἐν ὄρεσιν ἐν καθαρῷ τῷ νοΐ, τῷ φύσει μόνῳ καθαρῷ Θεῷ ὁμιλῶν, 
ὤφθης ἀρτιφανὴς ἀστὴρ καὶ ζῶν καὶ μετὰ πότμον 
ἀφθαρσίᾳ δοξάσας τὸ σὸν πανσέβαστον σκῆνος ὁ Κύριος, 
ᾧ ἐν γῇ, καθαρῶς ἐλάτρευσας, 
ἐδωρήσατο τῇ σῇ πατρίδι δῶρον τιμαλφέστατον, 
ὃ ἀσπαζόμενοι σὺν πόθῳ κράζομεν θερμῶς· φωστήρων χαῖρε, φωστὴρ Διονύσιε."
You took to heart the words of Christ the Teacher, 
and you took up His cross on your shoulders, 
and took the straight and narrow way of this life and never strayed. 
Discarding the weight kin, possessions, and all other earthly pleasures, 
alone on the mountains with purified mind, you conversed with God who alone is pure by nature.
And you were seen as new shining star while alive and after dying. 
The Lord, whom you worshiped on earth in purity, 
glorified your venerable body with incorruptibility, 
and He gave it to your homeland as a precious gift. 
Today, as we venerate it, we cry aloud, 
“We all salute you, O St. Dionysius.”
