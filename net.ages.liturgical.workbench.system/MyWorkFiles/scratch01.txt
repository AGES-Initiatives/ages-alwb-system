Τῆς Ναξίας τὸν γόνον καὶ σεπτὸν ἐγκαλλώπισμα, 
ἐν ὕμνοις τιμήσωμεν ἡγιασμένον Νικόλαον, 
τὸν Πλανᾶν μὲν τῇ κλήσει, 
ἀπλανῆ δὲ τὴν πίστιν, 
καὶ τὸν βίον εὐσχήμονα καὶ θεοφιλῆ. 
Αὐτὸς γὰρ συγκαλεῖται εἰς τράπεζαν πνευματικὴν τὰ οἰκεῖα τέκνα καὶ φιλοπάτορα, 
οὐ βρώσει ξενίζων καὶ πόσει, 
ἀλλὰ δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἄσκησιν ὑποδεικνὺς εἰς ἁγιασμόν.



He was the son of Naxos and its precious jewel, 
Saint Nicholas Planas. 
Let us sing hymns in honor of him. 
His faith was inerrant 
and his life was dignified and godly. 
He invites his loving spiritual children to a spiritual banquet, 
not serving them food and drink,
but showing them virtue and discipline, for their sanctification.
