Ψυχὰς ἃς μετέστησας, ἐκ τῶν προσκαίρων πρὸς σέ, 
ἀνάπαυσον Κύριε, ὡς Παντοδύναμος, 
καὶ μόνος ἀθάνατος, 
ἄνες ἄφες οἰκτίρμον, τὰ αὐτοῖς πεπραγμένα, 
ἐλέησον ἐλεῆμον, τῶν χειρῶν σου τὰ ἔργα, 
πρεσβείαις τῆς Θεοτόκου, μόνε φιλάνθρωπε.


Give rest to the souls that You translated from earth * 
and temporal things to be with You the only immortal almighty God. * 
Pardon them and forgive them * every sin they committed. * 
Merciful One, have mercy on the works of Your divine hands, * 
through the prayers of the Theotokos, O only benevolent Lord.
