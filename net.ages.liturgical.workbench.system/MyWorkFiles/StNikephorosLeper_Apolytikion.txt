Νικηφόρου Ὁσίου, τοῦ λεπροῦ τὰ παλαίσματα, 
καὶ τὴν ἐν ἀσκήσει ἀνδρείαν, κατεπλάγησαν Ἄγγελοι· 
ὡς ἄλλος γὰρ Ἰὼβ τὰ ἀλγεινά, ὑπέμεινε δοξάζων τὸν Θεόν, νῦν δὲ δόξῃ ἐστεφάνωται παρ’ Αὐτοῦ, θαυμάτων διακρίσεσιν. Χαίροις τῶν Μοναστῶν χειραγωγέ, χαίροις φωτὸς ὁ πρόβολος· χαίροις ὁ εὐωδίας χαρμονήν, προχέων ἐκ λειψάνων σου.


Ἄγγελοι κατεπλάγησαν τὰ παλαίσματα, καὶ τὴν ἐν ἀσκήσει ἀνδρείαν Νικηφόρου Ὁσίου, τοῦ λεπροῦ 

Angels were amazed at the struggles and the valor
in ascetic discipline of St. 

St. Nikephoros the Leper had astounded the angelic hosts,
with his struggles and his valor in ascetical discipline.
for he suffered very much throughout his life,
like Job of old, thus glorifying God,
who has crowned him now with glory, and distinguished him with miracles.
\"Rejoice, holy guide of monks and nuns! 
Rejoice! You project the light of God.
Rejoice! From your relics you pour out the fragrance of heavenly joy.\"
