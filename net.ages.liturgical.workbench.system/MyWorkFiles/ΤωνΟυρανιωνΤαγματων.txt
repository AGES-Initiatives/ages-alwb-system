Τῶν οὐρανίων ταγμάτων τὸ ἀγαλλίαμα, 
τῶν ἐπὶ γῆς ἀνθρώπων, κραταιὰ προστασία, 
ἄχραντε Παρθένε, σῶσον ἡμᾶς, 
τοὺς εἰς σὲ καταφεύγοντας, 
ὅτι ἐν σοὶ τὰς ἐλπίδας μετὰ Θεόν, 
Θεοτόκε ἀνεθέμεθα.


For all the powers of heaven you are exultant joy. 
For us on earth, O Lady, you are mighty protection. 
Pure and holy Virgin, save us, we pray, 
when for refuge we come to you. 
O Theotokos, for second only to God, 
it is you in whom we set our hopes.




For the celestial orders you are exultant joy  
and for earth-dwelling people * the almighty protection.  
Pure and holy Virgin, save us, we pray,  
as for refuge we flee to you,  
O Theotokos; for verily after God 
do we put our every hope in you.
